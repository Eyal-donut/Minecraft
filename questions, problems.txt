Problems:

1. local storage: If I would have had all the game into one object than it would be possible... but no.
2. To set everything back to zero? I removed classes, to add them back I'd need to target each element that I changed.
I could put all of the in an array, but then I would still not know who got a new class, who had his class removed etc.

Hard to implement:
The grid of the game was not eays all to create.

Review: I tried to use only classes at the beginning, but I ran into a lot of problems, si eventually I combiend global functions. I hope I could do this better.
